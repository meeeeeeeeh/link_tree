A link tree site is a little bit like a portfolio, but it also contains links to your socials as well as examples of your work.

Having a link tree means that you can put one single link in your socials profile, and that you only have to edit one place to update your links across multiple platforms.

Your link tree should have:
1. A picture of you at the top
2. Your name & social media handles
3. A series of mid size headings that link to examples of your work, your profiles and anything else that you're proud of.
